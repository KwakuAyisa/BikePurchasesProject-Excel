**GOAL OF THE PROJECT**

The goal of the project is to analyze bike sales data from the client to identify the factors that contribute to potential customers buying a bike or not. This will help the client with their pricing models as well as identifying locations for optimum bike sales. This analysis was then presented in an excel dashboard to make it easier for users to derive insights. 

**THE DATA**

•	The dataset was gotten from AlexTheAnalyst’s GitHub page. 

•	The data includes ID, Marital status, income, children, education, occupation, home ownership status, cars, commute distance, region, age, purchased bike.

**QUESTIONS**

•	What is the average income of those who purchased bikes?

•	Do the number of children in a household influence the purchase decision for bikes?

•	Which professions purchase the most bikes?

•	How many bikes were purchased in each region?

**ANALYSIS PROCESS**

1.	Copied the original sheet to use as a working sheet to keep the original data safe. 

2.	Removed duplicates from the dataset. 

3.	Used “Find and Replace” to change M and S in the Marital status column to Married or Single respectively.

4.	Used “Find and Replace” to change M and F in the gender column to Male or Female respectively.

5.	Created a nested IF statement for the age column to condense the different ages into Adolescent (0-30), Middle Age (31-54) and Old (55+) to make it easier for the analysis. 

6.	Created a pivot table from the cleaned data for the analysis.

Using the pivot tables we created the following tables and charts

•	Average income of purchase by gender.

•	Count of purchased bikes by customer commute distance.

•	Count of purchased bikes by customer age.

•	Count of purchased bikes by number of children.

•	Count of purchased bikes by profession.

•	Count of purchased bikes by region.

Inserted slicers in order to allow the dashboard user to filter down easily and make specific comparisons and analysis based on demographics.
